uchuu senkan yamato looks interesting 
gt  the series was a huge sensation despite the fact that nothing beyond the first season aired on american television until later the pause was due primarily to censorship issues  cartoons were seen purely as a children  s medium whose audience  according to american broadcasters  could not comprehend advanced concepts such as death or deal with excessive onscreen violence tezuka was personally approached and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this changed even a bit in the last  half a century  we see the same shit even today  and this is too short  i want more  ca nt wait for the next part  we will get into a more familiar territory for us and hopefully we can pick up a show or two from that period 
stop abandoningtking you griefer  
 time of eve   http  myanimelistnetanime7465eve_no_jikan_movie  has a very similar world and themes to ghost in the shell so you might like it   seirei no moribito   http  myanimelistnetanime1827seirei_no_moribito  is made by the same director as the ghost in the shell series and is a medieval fantasy just like berserk but not dark like berserk is worth trying i think  if you just want a movie  sword of the stranger   http  myanimelistnetanime2418stranger__mukou_hadan  is always good basically a movie dedicated to showing off awesome sword fights and lots of blood 
fatezero  also gundam ironblooded orphans is currently airing and it s pretty good  one punch man 
puella magi madoka magica and jojo s bizarre adventure pmmm only has 12 eps so it s easy to get into it s a masterpiece give it 3 eps before handing down your judgment 
try giving  tokyo ghoul  and   c   the money of soul and possibility control  a shot both of those have a darker feel  to cater to your  ninja scroll  interests 
darker than black season 1
