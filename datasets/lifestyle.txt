carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 

have my children

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe

are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

those tiny hamburgers look delicious
i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 

how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
method  instructions 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
cthulhu salad  count me in 
rreubens
serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 

fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
morbid
beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

can i have one  that looks amazing 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
master chef jr is the best 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
it s beautiful 

i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

did they taste good

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints
