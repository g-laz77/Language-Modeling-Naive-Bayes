recipe for those interested  this is a loose adaptation  created myself  of a homonymous dish at the marietta diner  in marietta  ga  prep time  10 min cook time  30 min 1 box of 12 mrs t s brand potatocheddar pierogi 1lb of chicken breast tenderloins half of a small yellow onion  chopped 1 red bell pepper  chopped about a cup of fresh spinach  chiffonade 2 cloves garlic  minced 1 cup half and half 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons olive oil  divided in half 2 tsp ap flour 12 cup romano cheese 12 cup shaved parmesan cheese green onions for garnish add 2t oil to large stainless pan  heat over medium high  add frozen pierogi cook for 68 min per side until golden brown on both sides  set aside in same pan  add the remaining oil  same heat  add the chicken tenderloin saltpepper to taste  turning after 34 min  lightly golden on both sides  set aside set oven to broil add onions and bell pepper to pan  over medium high  saut  for 6 min  add spinach  cook for 4 more minutes add butter  add garlic  cook 2 min until fragrant  add flour  stir to combine  cook 1 min add half and half slowly  allow to come back to a simmer  add milk slowly  bring back to a strong simmer simmer for 2 min  add the romano cheese  stir to combine add pierogi back to pan sauce  stir to cover  reduce heat and simmer for 12 min while slicing chicken  add chicken to pan  turn off heat  stir  plate the pierogi  chicken  sauce  and veggies in a stone ware bowl liberally sprinkle shaved parmesan and romano over dish  place in oven directly under broiler for 3 min or until golden brown garnish with green onions  and a little shaved parm 
carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 

have my children 



one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe

are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

those tiny hamburgers look delicious
i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 

how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
method  instructions 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

cthulhu salad  count me in 
rreubens
serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
master chef jr is the best 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
it s beautiful 

i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

did they taste good 



ingredients 2 cups chicken broth 1 tsp salt 4 chicken breasts 4 eggs  beaten   cup flour 1 cup panko 1 cup shredded parmesan cheese  tsp salt  tsp black pepper directions 1 make brine for chicken by dissolving salt with chicken broth in a medium bowl cover chicken breasts with plastic wrap and pound each one to about 12 inch thick with a kitchen mallet if breasts are large  you can cut them in half add flattened chicken to brine cover and chill for 3 hours  2 when chicken has marinated  remove the fillets from brine and dab with paper towels to remove excess liquid beat eggs in a medium bowl  and pour flour onto a plate combine breadcrumbs  parmesan cheese  salt and pepper in another medium bowl to bread the chicken  first coat each fillet with flour  then egg  and then the parmesan mixture rest  3 add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large saute pan  and heat over mediumlow until hot saute each breaded chicken fillet in oil for 45 minutes per side or until brown  4 cover with marinara and top with a slice of provolone  5 place in broiler until melty and delicious

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

hey look spaghetti 


this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 

make you own using mini muffin tray 
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak

hmm looks almost like a black salami
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
you did it right  my friend 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
your feelings look delicious 
you re the winner here
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
my mind went straight to rpopping
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
 removed 
made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
rketo
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 

looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 

hotter pan 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
do you eat the minifigures too 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
nice 


i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 
lemon juice for scale
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland

as my grandfather would say   it will eat   

be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 
time to get fat   d
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom

is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous

if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
recipe 
you mean jim lahey 
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
really gorgeous 
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 

how did you add the rosemary 

i can get onboard with this 
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i m not sure about this

recipe 
man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
yummy

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 

i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work

i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
my mind went straight to rpopping
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 

itssoraw
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
no crumbshot 
you had me at bacon 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
how are those arteries feeling 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already

they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
that is sexy af

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

thank you for this 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 

interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it

you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
that s a thing of beauty 
looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
looks great 
how d you keep it lit 

that meat looks dry and white 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
is there a recipe 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
looks good from here right on  man 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
it s so pretty

man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 
your chicken parm looks just like a metroid

lemon juice for scale
wow burger
looks good recipe 
i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
think i prefer the geordie method

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 
you had me at meat tornado

why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 



time to get fat   d

til australia has jury trials

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible

and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 


do nt ride the unagi not fun 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

and years and years old 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true

nice

damn nice attempt  

i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

looks like it should be in a magazine
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 

why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza
your wife looks like a dude
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
nailed it
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
upvote for effort op
pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
what did you do with the pork shoulder 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro

i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder

congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
you had me at meat tornado 
i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
oh wow that does actually look perfect
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i love burger
cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me

cream cheese and wheat thins 
i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post

the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
 removed 

i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends

priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
solid bread solid cutting board 
eat your heart out lt  3
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
your feelings look delicious 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
all over cooked 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 
that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

you forgot to cook it
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 
that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
spermtastic
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
that looks terrific  
i rate it m for magic 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
looks pretty damned delicious 
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

that s a ton of cookies 

i love burger

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder

there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now

my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it

hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work

bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4

looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 
monkfish

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 


the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  
looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 


that s a ton of cookies 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 



this just makes me so hungry

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket

that meat looks dry and white 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af

wow burger

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious
brisket is my fantasy food i ve never lived anywhere that had a place that was known for cooking it all the barbecue places around me only care about pork 
looks like franklin s in austin  can confirm it is amazing 
photographer robert jacob lerma learns how to take pictures with his phone 
gt  do nt lick the screen  do nt tell me how to live my life

home team bbq in charleston sc is amazing if you re ever this way

just one of the things i hate about living in pa and miss so very much by not living in tx 
 sigh  unzips    https  mimgurcom8edyruu 
definitely franklin s bbq in austin 
fuck me why was i born in a vegetarian family  
looks like i may need a sick day this week to go and get some bbq 
this made me realise just how much i m missing out by not owning a barbecue grill 
perfect bbq is when you do nt need any sauce
will you look at that  lunch time 
i licked it 
i m more curious about how that guy got that massive scar on his arm 
hey  i still have a couple hours til lunch break  screw you
those pickled red onions though ugh  so good love them with bbq and had them with the best lobster roll ever 
oh my fuck
what kind of meat is it in the first picture 
nom
i would eat that till i m doneby done dead 
also  this damn picture makes me angry hungry all i got around the house is peanut butter and some old turkey 
man i wish there was a place like that near me 
so happy we have life changing bbq in phoenix at little miss bbq guess they ve been around a couple years now but still feel new i love it so much 
i love bbq
my so just walked in on me licking the screen got some splainin to do 
snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 
i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did

hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

you animal 

that s a ton of cookies 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

recipe 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 
think i prefer the geordie method
your chicken parm looks just like a metroid
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 


i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 



a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though



the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
looks good recipe 


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 


i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great

okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

whered ya catch em 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

do you eat the minifigures too 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha

title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 


beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

that s not crab meat

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

can i get recipe 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

recipe for those interested  this is a loose adaptation  created myself  of a homonymous dish at the marietta diner  in marietta  ga  prep time  10 min cook time  30 min 1 box of 12 mrs t s brand potatocheddar pierogi 1lb of chicken breast tenderloins half of a small yellow onion  chopped 1 red bell pepper  chopped about a cup of fresh spinach  chiffonade 2 cloves garlic  minced 1 cup half and half 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons olive oil  divided in half 2 tsp ap flour 12 cup romano cheese 12 cup shaved parmesan cheese green onions for garnish add 2t oil to large stainless pan  heat over medium high  add frozen pierogi cook for 68 min per side until golden brown on both sides  set aside in same pan  add the remaining oil  same heat  add the chicken tenderloin saltpepper to taste  turning after 34 min  lightly golden on both sides  set aside set oven to broil add onions and bell pepper to pan  over medium high  saut  for 6 min  add spinach  cook for 4 more minutes add butter  add garlic  cook 2 min until fragrant  add flour  stir to combine  cook 1 min add half and half slowly  allow to come back to a simmer  add milk slowly  bring back to a strong simmer simmer for 2 min  add the romano cheese  stir to combine add pierogi back to pan sauce  stir to cover  reduce heat and simmer for 12 min while slicing chicken  add chicken to pan  turn off heat  stir  plate the pierogi  chicken  sauce  and veggies in a stone ware bowl liberally sprinkle shaved parmesan and romano over dish  place in oven directly under broiler for 3 min or until golden brown garnish with green onions  and a little shaved parm 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

whered ya catch em 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 


carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

time to get fat   d

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

i love burger

exquisite  

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 


you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  


exquisite  
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon

mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

creepyrrito
mouth orgasm

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though



the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 


i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 


crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 


did they taste good 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

did they taste good 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic



i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

creepyrrito
mouth orgasm

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 



whered ya catch em 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

this just makes me so hungry

as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

exquisite  

i love burger



i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa

i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 


did they taste good

looks pretty damned delicious 




you animal 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

that s a ton of cookies 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites

that s vegan right 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder

do you eat the minifigures too 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more

found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami

i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

whered ya catch em 

you animal 


looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white

portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

that s a ton of cookies 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

it should have been the daniel day lewis

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy

sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source

is it ticking 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now

my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious

i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in

how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 



do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 



beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3

ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

wow burger

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

did they taste good 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


that s a ton of cookies 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

whered ya catch em 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


i love burger

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad

i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

whered ya catch em 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 



the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  


i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

can i get recipe 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 


you animal 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in

how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings

your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot

kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 


looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


that s a ton of cookies 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


did they taste good 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here

i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches




recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 



i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

you animal 


i love burger

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

exquisite  

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this

i love you

good for you   is that a desirable job 


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

what is it 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 
 deleted 

i love burger
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible

exquisite  

you animal 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


recipe for those interested  this is a loose adaptation  created myself  of a homonymous dish at the marietta diner  in marietta  ga  prep time  10 min cook time  30 min 1 box of 12 mrs t s brand potatocheddar pierogi 1lb of chicken breast tenderloins half of a small yellow onion  chopped 1 red bell pepper  chopped about a cup of fresh spinach  chiffonade 2 cloves garlic  minced 1 cup half and half 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons olive oil  divided in half 2 tsp ap flour 12 cup romano cheese 12 cup shaved parmesan cheese green onions for garnish add 2t oil to large stainless pan  heat over medium high  add frozen pierogi cook for 68 min per side until golden brown on both sides  set aside in same pan  add the remaining oil  same heat  add the chicken tenderloin saltpepper to taste  turning after 34 min  lightly golden on both sides  set aside set oven to broil add onions and bell pepper to pan  over medium high  saut  for 6 min  add spinach  cook for 4 more minutes add butter  add garlic  cook 2 min until fragrant  add flour  stir to combine  cook 1 min add half and half slowly  allow to come back to a simmer  add milk slowly  bring back to a strong simmer simmer for 2 min  add the romano cheese  stir to combine add pierogi back to pan sauce  stir to cover  reduce heat and simmer for 12 min while slicing chicken  add chicken to pan  turn off heat  stir  plate the pierogi  chicken  sauce  and veggies in a stone ware bowl liberally sprinkle shaved parmesan and romano over dish  place in oven directly under broiler for 3 min or until golden brown garnish with green onions  and a little shaved parm 


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

whered ya catch em 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

what is it 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

exquisite  

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

i love burger

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 


recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake

that s a ton of cookies 


looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white

i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites

that s vegan right 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

can i get recipe 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

did they taste good 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

you animal 

exquisite  
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 


that s a ton of cookies 


looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 


i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented

my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings

you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

this just makes me so hungry

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent

extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together

love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
 deleted 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too

what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder

had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 


i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng

holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

you animal

sounds delicious

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 



that s a ton of cookies 


i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve

exquisite  

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon

i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 


it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88



the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts

i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i love burger
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti

recipe 

did they taste good 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 


my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

upvote for being from minnesota

were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 



damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

what is it 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket

hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

that s a ton of cookies

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry

nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting

can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where

 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i love burger

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 





this just makes me so hungry

i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger

odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

what is it 


exquisite  

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

it should have been the daniel day lewis

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 



i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 


i love burger
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex

the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

lemon juice for scale
wow burger
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts

i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
i really like when men cook cupcakes

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

looks like it should be in a magazine

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else
 deleted 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends

love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow

can i get recipe 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 


that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 


a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 


can i get recipe 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

you animal 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 



cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

that s a ton of cookies 

this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from

i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

can i get recipe 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 


serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

mouth orgasm

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

 removed 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro

i can get onboard with this

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg

well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen

alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey

where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 



gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

hey look spaghetti

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough

do you eat the minifigures too 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever

that meat looks dry and white 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

that s a ton of cookies 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i love burger

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha

you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol

that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great

i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky

were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 



i love burger
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 
time to get fat   d

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

that s a ton of cookies 

exquisite  

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please

your feelings look delicious

can i get recipe 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

did they taste good 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches


hey looks great  whats the recipe please 


i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

i love burger

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 


i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

crust recipe  please

i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

whered ya catch em 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 




this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 


serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

can i get recipe 


pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i love burger

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome

bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

what is it 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it

recipe 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 


i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

you animal 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng

you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon

mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it

i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef

i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

whered ya catch em 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe

your chicken parm looks just like a metroid

looks good recipe 
recipe 
i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

you animal 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

that s a ton of cookies 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns

call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

recipe 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer

i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too

yummy and delicious

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 



looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please

sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

exquisite  

i love burger


i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

did they taste good 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota

what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 


orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

did they taste good 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite

i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 



what is it 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

i love burger

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

exquisite  

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

did they taste good

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it

no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image

i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v

just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

creepyrrito
mouth orgasm

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious

i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i love burger


whered ya catch em 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

that s a ton of cookies

chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

exquisite

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  


i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

this just makes me so hungry

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 


can i get recipe 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 


beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt

mexican food is the best 

time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish

your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented

looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

that s a ton of cookies

love for pizza

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 


i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
 removed 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88


i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 


cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket

do you eat the minifigures too 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious

i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 


exquisite  

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

i m not sure about this

i can get onboard with this 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 

this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious

way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

what is it 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh

cucumber  daikon

mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it

mexican food is the best 


my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd

okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

lemon juice for scale
wow burger
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

i really like when men cook cupcakes 
 removed 


this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 


damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

did they taste good 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
 removed 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

what is it 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty

exquisite  


the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 


i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa

i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

you animal 


i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt

great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing

i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

you animal 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 



i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend

your feelings look delicious

your feelings look delicious

i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious

call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

whered ya catch em 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 



pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 


gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 



i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i love burger

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

did they taste good 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 


you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 


that s a ton of cookies 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

creepyrrito
mouth orgasm

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza


did they taste good 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

your hand looks like a delicious brisket

that meat looks dry and white 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

can i get recipe 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  



cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

you animal 



i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce


a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more

rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant

what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 


i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious


the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas

do you eat the minifigures too 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 



that s a ton of cookies 

exquisite  

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 


looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 



orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting

the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful

damn this could make me go vegan

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends

awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota

looks delicious

needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night

your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

i love burger
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 


i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 


i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 
 deleted 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh

how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon

jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night

ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

whered ya catch em 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

that s a ton of cookies 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

what is it 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 


that s a ton of cookies 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

you animal 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 


looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 


i love burger

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 


i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye

cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef

those tiny hamburgers look delicious
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 


did they taste good 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious

i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

what is it 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 



i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

this just makes me so hungry

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

looks good recipe 
recipe 
i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww

nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

 removed 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 


looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though


this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

you animal 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i love burger

exquisite  

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now

my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend

what part of the midwest are you from

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

yummy and delicious

can i get recipe 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

 removed 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland

what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

recipe 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person





you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 
time to get fat   d

i love burger

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww


now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

you animal 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 


carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

can i get recipe 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 


you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should

what is it 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite

whered ya catch em 


i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami

method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends

i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 



gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 


this just makes me so hungry 
put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious
brisket is my fantasy food i ve never lived anywhere that had a place that was known for cooking it all the barbecue places around me only care about pork

definitely franklin s bbq in austin 
fuck me why was i born in a vegetarian family  
looks like i may need a sick day this week to go and get some bbq 
this made me realise just how much i m missing out by not owning a barbecue grill 
perfect bbq is when you do nt need any sauce
will you look at that  lunch time

i m more curious about how that guy got that massive scar on his arm 
hey  i still have a couple hours til lunch break  screw you
those pickled red onions though ugh  so good love them with bbq and had them with the best lobster roll ever 
oh my fuck
what kind of meat is it in the first picture

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying

recipe 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 


did they taste good 

can i get recipe 

you animal 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please

recipe 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


til australia has jury trials 
did you eat from ernesto food truck and eat empanadas 
jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 



looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born

i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

it should have been the daniel day lewis 
the totonka

whered ya catch em 


i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v

solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer

i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 


i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches


though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

i love burger
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that

nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients

my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 



that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day

wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 
 deleted 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

 removed 

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science


i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 



this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

what is it 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day

were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

whered ya catch em 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here

ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4

i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

what is it 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite

nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

exquisite  

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

this just makes me so hungry

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 


cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it

ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt

i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous

they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 


gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 


i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  


the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat

had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

i love burger
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent

swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
time to get fat   d

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it

ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great

you animal 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too

yummy and delicious
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

what is it 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 


recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

you animal 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did

hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 


i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it

the totonka

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i love burger

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  
though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter
 removed 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
time to get fat   d

perfect bbq is when you do nt need any sauce

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 



whered ya catch em 
 deleted 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 



i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 


that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 


looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

i love burger
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever

chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens

jury nulification is power please consider a not guilty on all charges which are victimless and or pointless laws you disagree with

time to get fat   d

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha

your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing

 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious

i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else

can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 


exquisite  
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

that s a ton of cookies 

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking

that cupcake is dope i d almost buy a print of that  if i liked cupcakes more 
thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 


one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid


kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder


i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 


a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

did they taste good 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

i would love the recipe for your chicken parm  looks delicious
chicken parm is my favorite
one of my favorites  
think i prefer the geordie method
that s vegan right 


looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

exquisite  

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

recipe  here    http  boredoftheinternetcucumbertowncomagaveteriyakichickenrecipe 
do you eat the minifigures too 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  


i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

can i get recipe

i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 


i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm

i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

you animal 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish

does the cocaine add to the flavor

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 


i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches

what is it 

i love burger

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man

looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v

solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


did they taste good 

 removed 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty

way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 


i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends

http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares

nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op

upvote for effort op

very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

exquisite  
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 


you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints


lemon juice for scale
wow burger

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

whered ya catch em 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect

i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else




carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too

rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it

ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it

hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot

all over cooked

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed

surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

do you eat the minifigures too 

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

you have a gift  i d look at some culinary schools if i was you 
your food looks amazing you should really try to further that
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
looks great 
great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder


looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb

that s a ton of cookies 


 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful

ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 


i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down

had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous
recipe 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

i d normally have schnitzel with kartoffelsalat instead of sp  tzle but both are awesome 
milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 
close enough lol
where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too cant wait to try it out 
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
i rate it m for magic 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine

to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 


one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 

looks delicious  recipe 
yummy and delicious

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder


damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

did they taste good 

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke

definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it s a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you re talented 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god

great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it

i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
monkfish
mussels are cheap and tasty  recipes   http  allrecipescomrecipes439seafoodshellfishmussels 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 
 deleted 
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter
 removed 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 


serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

what is it 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op

is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend

you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking

i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i love burger

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 


want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 


i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old 
gr8 b8 m8 i r8 88

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i m glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i m fully erect
call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
how do i get one of these sent to my boyfriend 
you also specialize in trichinosis i m sure 
i love you 
 you re my clogged heart 
good for you   is that a desirable job 

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 


cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

what is it 

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

that s a ton of cookies 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it s made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 
i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 


looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d
looks pretty damned delicious 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter


made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
looks like your meatloaf is happy to see you 
my wife and i will make you our valentine if you make that shit and bring it over
and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese

great looking food  i hope you find your way to a better job soon just keep on keeping on 
i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

you animal 

can i get recipe 


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more

do you eat the minifigures too 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though



wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i usually do nt like fish but i love scallops the problem is they re too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i m single all mine

rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night

hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot

i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 


beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

can i get recipe 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

did they taste good 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

whered ya catch em

i see a future in fine dining for you   reach for it 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket

that meat looks dry and white

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

exquisite  

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends

love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww

are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

wow  that looks soooo good  edit  what s it like in dublin  i have always pictured it as mostly rainy with quaint little bars all over the place serving fish amp  chips someplace where you would walk to go get your groceries and buy fresh bread etc and have a pot of stew over an actual fire in the fireplace yeah  i have daydreamed of living there  but with zero facts  p
is it ticking 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins

you animal 


i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

lemon juice for scale
wow burger

looks really ggod but ca nt help htink you just wasted some hella good steak by eating it in a sandwich rather than as a fillet by its own 
you made steak sammiches out of wagyu  bruh
you made sandwiches with wagyu beef 
how much was the wagyu per lb 
cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally 
jealous also surprised to see someone from denver use the term  hoagie roll   you from njpa 
steak  pat steaks dry  season well with salt and pepper  cook 4 min per side in a hot pan let rest 5 min  sandwich  cut hoagie rolls open but leave them intact  pull out some of the doughy interior from each side mix up some sriracha mayo and slather some on the bottom of rolls top with cilantro  pickled jalape  o and carrot slices and a handful of steak with some juice close roll and since in half  romanesco  chop florets off of core  halve if large toss with a little olive oil and cook in preheated 425 oven for 15 min  turning regularly to avoid over browning when done  toss with prepared nuoc cham  lime juice  fish sauce  sugar  water  plus a little sambal or chopped thai chile  and some chopped mint toss with puffed rice cereal  i toss with five spice and toast in a pan first   props to david chen for the inspiration for this recipe 
what the actual fuck pickled japs and carrots  might as well throw some easymac on those sandwiches too  do nt forget the fry sauce  ewww
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 


that s not crab meat 
yummy  whats your recipe 
mmmm immitation crab 
i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

damn son how did you get that egg in it without the outer layer 
looks good  i ve always wanted to make these the sausage looks a bit rare toward the center though 
i remember my first time making scotch eggs  wanted to keep the yolk runny just like you did and i spent over half an hour meticulously peeling an undercooked egg looks great 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together

i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please 
i hate pistachio flavored stuff  but that is gorgeous

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though  
method  instructions 
rreubens
fuck me  that s amazing can you please put instructions and recipe that looks incredible
can i have one  that looks amazing 
and proceed to skimp on the meat in the sandwiches



beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it s just a joke 

that s a ton of cookies 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in

call it a broquet  bro 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
you had me at meat tornado 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it

good for you   is that a desirable job 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor

thank you for compiling everyone s work  umeatyelbow it s awesome to have uorvane as a new member really great work  everyone 
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
can we discuss how everyone in teamlet sgosavebarryandjessie was wielding an actual weapon and earth2 barry is holding a stick  fucking ridiculous 

hey looks great  whats the recipe please 
i had a dish in indonesia of curried jackfruit with chicken it was so damn tasty i am sure this is too  
i just did some homemade carolina vinegar sauce and i was wondering what is the fridge life of it  vinegar  sugar  tabasco  red pepper  catchup  i know  sacrilege  right   and salt  by the way it tasted great 
nothing in that recipe will spoil when refrigerated it should be good for months 

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie

holy hell those are huge

nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 

what is it 

beautiful how do ribs break down in the sous vide  may i ask how much your machine costs and what kind  cooking is my passion  but they are such expensive and limited real estate in my small kitchen 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
hey  i m looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that is nt perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
make you own using mini muffin tray 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 

did they taste good

that s fantastic looks like you had an amazing dinner how d you make the cake  recipe 
i always forget how disgusting and unappealing ratatouille looks 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic
i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 
recipe 

exquisite  

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though


now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used 
 rainbow dash approves   http  img05deviantartnetdc36i201221368happy_dashie_is_best_dashie_by_mrlolcats17d57726fpng

put a picture of some burnt ends in there if you like to eat samples you literally get a meal of sample meat and it s delicious

snows bbq  it s like hot sex in your mouth  if you live near the austin area and have never had snows bbq  you owe it to yourself to take the hour long trip to lexington  tx open only on saturdays  they usually run out by noonbut it s the best in the state  http  wwwsnowsbbqcom
way too toasted 
you overcooked the meat 
it s not pork 
so much of this is overcooked i m sad  
taste buds and appetite going all crazy right now 
i ve never seen kansas city spelled with a tx 
brisket does nothing for me
the only real bbq is lexington style 
as 2014 pitmaster of the year  bbq magazine weekly  i say this is a dog shit piece of meat  over cooked mostly
everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
i could chipotle going asian and making these 
is nt that just a uncut sushi roll 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
i ve never heard of masami  wagyu  or even what coulotte is  however  that is a gorgeous piece of meat how did you cook it  op 
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i m leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
that is sexy af
where does one purchase wagyu  it s been on my bucket list to try  but in all honesty i have nt done too much research as i assume it s a costly import for good reason though 
i would put that mother fucker on a sandwich and drench it garlic sauce
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother 
the thumbnail photo looks like someone s infected lips but wow that looks delicious  the food  not the infected lips 
you forgot to cook it
there s a difference between wagyu beef and  american  wagyu beef manami is  american  wagyu beef 

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 
mexican food is the best 


crust recipe  please 
love for pizza

though it s probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video
that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i should nt have tried on valentine s day 
your wife looks like a dude
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8

where are people getting fresh fruit this time of year  lol i live in a desert
close enoughhell  that s fuckin  perfect 
upvote for effort op
awww  this is incredibly sweet     no pun intended 
very nice  
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i d expect from a restaurant

ah nothing says classy like pyrex

 recipe   http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaydoublechocolatepancakeswithsaltedcaramelsaucehtml 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i do nt know why no one else commented but that looks good af 

lemon juice for scale

you animal 

this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i was nt prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i m going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 

i m a huge fan of composed salads like this looks very nice
cthulhu salad  count me in 
do you have the recipe for me  looks delicious   
how do you cook the octopus  i find it really hard to do correctly 
morbid

kidney beans  zucchini  tomato  red pepper  water saut  ed red onion and button mushrooms  topped with avocado  chili tahini dressing and hemp seeds  for dressing  combine  1t tahini 2t water 2t lime juice 1t honey 1t chipotle seasoning 12t chili powder 14t garlic powder

gt  the spices what spices we must know
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

you animal 

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami

i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess 

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 


i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it s excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

can i get recipe 

what is it 

now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 
i like that it s rainbow but it looks normal i m from brooklyn and my stomach felt weird after eating one of those rainbow bagels that went viral a week or two ago  you have awesome friends 
this is one of the finest looking  simple  cakes i ve seen it does make this cake look like it would taste rainbows 
love the pastel colors 
wait is there a colour missing  looks good though
http  imgurcomxpki8nr made one for my girlfriends birthday last year  was nt that hard to make but needs a lot of food coloring  can turn your shit green if you eat too much 
that s so gay 
that cake looks so rich skittles taste the raindow
looks amazing  i have never seen it done with such light coloring how did you make the shades more pastel instead of bright   is there a specific brand of food coloring that you used

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 
portuguese food  the best  d
i like the wine glass any idea what it s calledwhere it s sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
hotter pan 

i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

everytime i go to texas  i try to find good bbq but i ca nt all the bbq i have ever eaten  at restaurants  has always been so fucking spicy that it makes you numb we went to one place that had meat marinated in ghost chili  habanero and tabasco the only bbq i liked from texas came from bill millers and that s because i could actually taste the meat 
all over cooked 

i made this gordon ramsay style did nt even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i ve never made beef wellington before i actually do nt cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 


want 
were those pancakes cooked in a ring mold  the sides look kind of shear and have a lighter color than i would expect 



gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious

i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
this is one of the few instances where it looks just as good as it did in the video

hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it was nt thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it did nt do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it did nt just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
ya i spent 2hrs trying to make the ball yesterday ended up with a really expensive puddle of white chocolate nice work man what you shove inside the ball 
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
reference  that looks delicious
you didnt smooth the edges with a warm spoon
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i d be  super  impressed 
nailed it
i m wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
surprised this is nt in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and di nt think of every detail  
ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
that looks terrific  
looks amazing what did your wife say 
was nt the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you do nt get as clean of a cut through the ball 
i like your fireplace
spermtastic
i could nt even find a plastic orb so i ended up using large plastic easter eggs then when i went to take it out the damn thing did nt seam together so i used halves  which then broke  all in all not my best but my fiance loved it anyway so who cares
awwwwww
yum 
nice 
the filling of this dessert made me think of this  lad   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  wyx_zhltdr8 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op

upvote for effort op

priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face

ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
damn nice attempt  


nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i ve got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 
i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie 
bryan 
holy hell those are huge 
have my children 
it looks slightly overcooked but i m sure it still tasted amazing 
nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
time to get fat   d
be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 




quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we re up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
interesting that it s actually  jim lahey    http  blogswearnetcomwpcontentuploads201506tpb10_amfa_lahey_june10p1splashscreen011024x576jpg  s recipe 
recipe 
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
i make these every couple of weeks in the winter  never had a bad loaf   lahey bread   http  iimgurcomknq46tljpg 
no crumbshot 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
bavarian here  i love bread and while in america i miss eating it so this was good reading and will give it a try have a look at  der b  ckerberater   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  rs5onmfzzuy 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 
if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
i ca nt stop looking at this fucking bread i m going to make it my laptop lockscreen 
you mean jim lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i did nt do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i d made it myself 
is nt this just damper  bread  http  wwwbestrecipescomaurecipeeasyaustraliandamperl3230html
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i do nt know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly is nt  it s a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just did nt notice  and attribution is nt dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i seem to have wandered into the wrong room i came here looking for more information on the delicious looking food in the image 
where the fuck is the link for the lazy  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes11376nokneadbread
instead of all the critical analysis  can someone please just post a reciperegardless of the number of ingredients  
no knead to brag
i tried this last night and it came out super hard tasted like crap    guess im gon na have to try again   cant say curse words on this sub  freaking lame  man 
i ve had good luck with this recipe as well super easy  overnight rising  and turns out super tasty 
thank you for this 
awesome
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i d like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it does nt have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
this is awesome for deep dish pizza in cast iron  though this is in cake pans http  imgurcomaserzw
i have a 2 ingredient dough recipe that works great for flatbreads  pizza  and the like 1 cup self rising dough  1 cup greek yogurt i usually add another half cup of whatever other flour i want to get a doughier consistency knead  then roll bake normally 
hey man  i do nt know the recipe you re talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
i made this over thanksgiving  mine turned out well too it was delicious my danish mother in law was impressed so there s that  it s a great simple recipe a little time consuming but worth it 
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
really gorgeous 
it works with pizza too  https  imgurcoman7k7v
do nt you mean even breader than expected 
just to quickly clear one thing up for everyone mark bittman is not a member to the buttman family   in living color  the buttman s   https  youtubenstjvgxicpu 
solid bread solid cutting board 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it s tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i do nt know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous 
no knead bread  i m curious how does that work 
how did you add the rosemary 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i ca nt recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
nice photo and nice bread
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 


that s a ton of cookies 

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl 

i m a 25 year old female but i would like to be your husband please

rketo
i went to a fancy indian place by my self fuck it 
damn this looks amazing will give gold for recipe post 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you do nt mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha

resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe

cucumber  daikon 
this looks insanely tasty 
mmmmm i love wagyu now i m going to be on a mission to find it locally

i consider myself to be a decent chef for being self trained but i m always looking to strengthen my skills i m looking for recipes that are difficult to make  include spices you do nt normally use  take more steps than usual  tests you and makes you question why combinations were made 
making various sushi dishes require a fair amount of intricacydelicacy and a reasonable amount of skill with a knife particularly if you start with a whole fish 

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

recipe  here   https  wwwchefstepscomactivitiesamazingchewybagelsfromscratch  modifications   portioned them to 104g  or 10 bagels  instead of 65g  just used what i had on hand for toppings and did nt measure  maldon salt  sesame seeds  dried garlic  dried onion  verdict  very chewy in a good way  had a softer crust than i expected  but delicious nonetheless i ll definitely be adding this to my recipe arsenal  edit  sorry  ca nt seem to change asterisks to bulletpoints

mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 


orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
oh wow that does actually look perfect
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i ve ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
rmacarons
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
beautiful  what was the main issues you had with previous batches 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage

i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else

pretty good clickbait title  if you re concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it s one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
and years and years old

croissant is hard if you can make croissant  you are a baker  favorite thing in all the world  croissant with bitter orange marmalade 
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it s all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
those look near perfect  nicely done a
they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i ve only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods

you ca nt just post that and leave without giving us a recipe for that beautiful hunk of meat 
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise has nt got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
cook me food like that and i ll be your valentine 
you re the winner here
hmm looks almost like a black salami
you did it right  my friend 
this is easily one of the greatest things i ve ever seen did nt over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i d vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after last night 
eat your heart out lt  3
i like your knife set  we have the same one
you should store your evoo in a cool dark place cmon bruh 
your feelings look delicious 
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
it looks like a homemade valentines food based fleshlight 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
well now that i look at your username  i see it was nt just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
that s a thing of beauty 
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i ve used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i ve made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i m cooking for someone picky 
i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
recipe  oh please  oh 
the internet has ruined me 
my mind went straight to rpopping
 this   http  imgurcomszh4xa9  is called a bacon eggsplosion  no eggs in it  and it s in a similar vein it s a weave of bacon with 1 lb of breakfast sausage on that  wrapped around a sausage with cheese 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
i ll be you re valentine if you cook me meals like that jesus christ that looks amazing
i m a vegetarian and this turns me on 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i m not alone in eating my feelings
if these are your feelings i think it might be a crime to be your valentine 
you know what you ca nt wrap in bacon  the hole in your heart 
recipe 
that piece of meat could be my valentine any day op  nice work 
your feelings sound delicious 
hello it s me  your valentine 
i started implanting my meatloafs with egg it s super tasty perhaps you d like to give it a shot 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast 
kfc as my valentine best yet  she did nt leave me after night night 
everytime i try to make baconwrapped anything  it seems the bacon does nt cook all the way and gets soggy or whatever what is the secret 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
is there a recipe 
can i have a slice of your feelings please 
you had me at bacon 
you made this bealty  good job  know i m really hungry haha
oh my that loaf looks glazetastic yum
title could be the name of a fall out boy song
you wo nt have a problem getting a valentines date when packing that meat 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these 
that would make perfect sammich material there  sooo good  mmmmmm  sorry about the drool 
you ve basically forced me to replicate this dinner for my self tonight 
and you were alone on valentine s day  how has no one snapped you up  bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed meatloaf  that s fucking brilliant clearly you need no one 
saw deadpool in imax then made fried chicken coleslaw and chocolate milk

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
what part of the midwest are you from 
it s ok  i got fast food  but this looks really good  recipe please 
resisting desire to make joke about valentine being meat stuffed with creamy white stuff 
if you can cook like that you should have a valentine edit  hopefully next year  
sweet cheesy jesus give me some
you either make an album and give me a recipe orori will completely screw it up 
your feelings look delicious 
we mix feta in with our meat it s fucking amazing 
this looks like the best thing ever
 kaiser tiger   http  kaisertigercomkaisertigermenu  in chicago has something almost similar but called  the bomb   no mozzarella tho    5 lbs of spicy beef and pork sausage stuffed with pepper bacon and wrapped in a brown sugar bacon weave cooked for hours on the smoker and served with fresh cut fries  buns  pepper jack cheese  onion  lettuce  tomato  and bbq sauce 
your feelings look delicious 
are you sure you did nt fuck that meatloaf
i would rather have the cheese than the stuff around it but that is just my love of cheese cheese over everything else 
i had sex then a kale salad on valentines day
i wish my feelings were as delicious as this 
did you use a glaze if so what did you use 
you have the most beautiful mind how the hell did you even come up with this   please pass along the recipe 


i m a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i m having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i do nt know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i m not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me
honestly if it s szechuan  and it s in mandarin on the menu  it probably does nt matter what you order it will be good

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i m on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

i m familiar with various forms of acid based  cooking  like ceviche  tartare  etc but is it possible to similarly  cook  or break down a vegetable like say asparagus by using lemon juice or the like if you marinade it long enough

serious question i thought smoked corned beef with an outer coating of black pepper was pastrami anyone know the difference between corned beef amp  pastrami 
great looking meat i like mine sloppy though  with lots of sauerkraut and dressing 
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
i ve never had a bad reuben before
the meat was pre packedbrined outside rub was coriander  dry mustard  pepper  smoked paprika  garlic  and salt smoked for 7 hours  next time we will brine it ourselves but we had a hell of a time finding a brisket at the store we tried for 2 weeks before we finally bought this to try it was so good though

i can be quite the show addict  and i ve seen some great shows on food i d love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it s hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it s a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
chef and the farmer on pbs chef s table on netflix
hey  you should check out  mind of a chef   it s pretty amazing and they follow along with lots of great chefs it s also shot beautifully i second that you should also check out  chef s table  on netflix  a matter of taste  is also great  enjoy 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it s about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you re familiar with new orleans  it s fun recognizing all the places if you ve ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you d also enjoy good eats and chopped if you do nt already 
definitely good eats and i really liked no reservations because i love anthony bourdain  but it is a bit more of a travel show i guess

milanesas pap   milanesas 
i have never in my life seen anyone eat sp  tzle with a fucking schnitzel 
das ist lecker  ich liebe schnitzel jetztich habe hunger  
loving that salad on the plate  perfect size i reckon 
odd combination but the schnitzels look nice 
i had venison schnitzel with spaetzle at a german restaurant in windhoek  namibiamy first experience with german food  and it was absolutely fantastic now i m hungry 
looks incredible but this is like 4 meals  worth of food 
schaut richtig lecker aus 
ahh yes the cheese noodle thingy aka mac and cheese  emmental  
that s austrian but looks very good  normally you do not combine these two haha but great idea to not starve for about 2 days haha
bleh  dry schnitzel i always have mine with some kind of so  e  j  ger  preferably 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts do nt conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful

i really like when men cook cupcakes 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

i m not sure about this
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i can get onboard with this 


i m sure it tastes amazing  but that looks like its hard to keep down 
itssoraw
it s so pretty 

looks like you smoked it on a little too high a temperature smoking   cooking per sey get the final cook at the end anyhow  the smoke ring is very narrow so it was nt smoked long enough to get the smoke flavor very deep into the meat 
i want some now 
how d you keep it lit 
looks good  youve got a good bark going and everything my only recommendation would be to let it smoke at a lower temp for longer to get a more pronounced smoke ring  the red around the edge  
keep your head up  you ll get it right one of these days 
in before people call it burnt  looks tasty ca nt wait for the weather to warm up so i can get the smoker back out  what kind of smoker did you use 
have any pictures of the point  this appears to be the flat 
do nt get addicted  you ll be on patches forever 
psa  brisket prices will go to the next month since st patrick s day is coming up costco already is selling  flat  cut for  799lb 
smoked       practice makes perfect still looks good though
your hand looks like a delicious brisket
looks good from here right on  man 
that meat looks dry and white 


i was picturing frasier making it in a hurry because he had promised someone a cake or something  but then i saw it was much too elegant for him  besides  i would have remembered an episode with him and i cake i think 
are you spelling frasier wrong and making a cake unrelated to frasier  or is fraisier something else
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 

do nt ride the unagi not fun 
why do nt american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
ahhhhhhh  salmon skin roll 
https  youtubegp7zbvplei4
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
looks pretty great wish they had it like this where i live but the sushi is good enough for now i guess 
i love unagiso yummy    my local fish market will kill the unagi for you if you ask  cause i m a wussy

looks like it should be in a magazine
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
why take out the seeds 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i m interesting in trying caviar  i ve never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i ll eat the fish like a normal person
i decided to spoil myself last night with a delicious burger i made some fresh garlic mayo  was a bit oilier tasting than usual but still great   thick cut smoked bacon  a fried egg  boar s head white american  lettuce onion and ketchup on a potato roll toasted in the bacon drippings it looks a bit tall in the pic  but it s just the perspective i used the  smash  method on a cast skillet heated up on the grill easily the tastiest burger i have ever made  wwwimgurcomagcvg0d

if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas  

i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
awfully cooked for a manny s steak 
you over paid by  50 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store 
what cut is that  how many pounds  does nt look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
upvote for being from minnesota 
why is it so overcooked 
looks juicy shame it s cooked mediumwell 
looks delicious
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
why was this steak  63  lol

the only garnish i need for my mimosa is a second mimosa 
if i could expense the meal i would order it otherwise for  28  i ll take 3 or 4 regular mimosas

portuguese food  the best  d

extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho
